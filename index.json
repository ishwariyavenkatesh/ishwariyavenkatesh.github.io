Members of the KLF family of transcription factors can exert both positive and negative effects on axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that forced expression of KLF6 promotes axon regeneration by corticospinal tract neurons in the injured spinal cord. RNA sequencing identified 454 genes whose expression changed upon forced KLF6 expression in vitro, including sub-networks that were highly enriched for functions relevant to axon extension including cytoskeleton remodeling, lipid synthesis, and bioenergetics. In addition, promoter analysis predicted a functional interaction between KLF6 and a second transcription factor, STAT3, and genome-wide footprinting using ATAC-Seq data confirmed frequent co-occupancy. Co-expression of the two factors yielded a synergistic elevation of neurite growth in vitro.

This loss of axon growth ability likely reflects widespread changes in gene expression, but the mechanisms that drive this shift remain unclear. Chromatin accessibility has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in other cellular contexts, raising the possibility that chromatin structure may contribute to the age‐dependent loss of regenerative potential. Here we establish an integrated bioinformatic pipeline that combines analysis of developmentally dynamic gene networks with transcription factor regulation and genome‐wide maps of chromatin accessibility. When applied to the developing cortex, this pipeline detected overall closure of chromatin in sub‐networks of genes associated with axon growth. We next analyzed mature CNS neurons that were supplied with various pro‐regenerative transcription factors. Unlike prior results with SOX11 and KLF7, here we found that neither JUN nor an activated form of STAT3 promoted substantial corticospinal tract regeneration. Correspondingly, chromatin accessibility in JUN or STAT3 target genes was substantially lower than in predicted targets of SOX11 and KLF7. Finally, we used the pipeline to predict pioneer factors that could potentially relieve chromatin constraints at growth‐associated loci. Overall this integrated analysis substantiates the hypothesis that dynamic chromatin accessibility contributes to the developmental decline in axon growth ability and influences the efficacy of pro‐regenerative interventions in the adult, while also pointing toward selected pioneer factors as high‐priority candidates for future combinatorial experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Developmental chromatin restriction of pro‐growth gene networks acts as an epigenetic barrier to axon regeneration in cortical neurons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Venkatesh I**","Blackmore MG"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498176000,"objectID":"8684df2cd0bd9b0fed29c1116cb8e9cd","permalink":"https://ishwariyavenkatesh.github.io/publication/optimaltf/","publishdate":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/optimaltf/","section":"publication","summary":"Recovery from injuries to the central nervous system, including spinal cord injury, is constrained in part by the intrinsically low ability of many CNS neurons to mount an effective regenerative growth response. To improve outcomes, it is essential to understand and ultimately reverse these neuron-intrinsic constraints. Genetic manipulation of key transcription factors (TFs), which act to orchestrate production of multiple regeneration-associated genes, has emerged as a promising strategy. It is likely that no single TF will be sufficient to fully restore neuron-intrinsic growth potential, and that multiple, functionally interacting factors will be needed. An extensive literature, mostly from non-neural cell types, has identified potential mechanisms by which TFs can functionally synergize. Here we examine four potential mechanisms of TF/TF interaction; physical interaction, transcriptional cross-regulation, signaling-based cross regulation, and co-occupancy of regulatory DNA. For each mechanism, we consider how existing knowledge can be used to guide the discovery and effective use of TF combinations in the context of regenerative neuroscience.

Adult CNS neurons may lack appropriate pro-regenerative transcription factors, or may display chromatin structure that restricts transcriptional access to RAGs. Here we performed epigenetic profiling around the promoter regions of key RAGs, and found progressive restriction across a time course of cortical maturation. These data identify a potential intrinsic constraint to axon growth in adult CNS neurons. Neurite outgrowth from cultured postnatal cortical neurons, however, proved insensitive to treatments that improve axon growth in other cell types, including combinatorial overexpression of AP1 factors, overexpression of histone acetyltransferases, and pharmacological inhibitors of histone deacetylases. This insensitivity could be due to intermediate chromatin closure at the time of culture, and highlights important differences in cell culture models used to test potential pro-regenerative interventions.","tags":null,"title":"Epigenetic profiling reveals a developmental decrease in promoter accessibility during cortical maturation in vivo.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nAxons are the cables in your nervous system that carry information from the brain to the rest of the body. Injured adult mammalian neurons in the central nervous system (CNS) fail to re-grow axons (Spinal cord injury), resulting in irreversible permanent damage. However, in nature, several types of neurons are intrinsically capable of robust axon regeneration following injury. These include early post-natal CNS neurons that then lose the capacity for re-growth in a developmental transition. How and why is this capacity for regeneration unequally retained across development? More importantly, how can we reprogram injured CNS neurons to re-mount a successful regenerative response? TFs which simultaneously regulate the expression of several regeneration-associated proteins, is one effective way to improve regenerative outcomes following injury. And yet even with the best of TF treatments, the number and distance of regenerating axons falls short of what is needed for full functional recovery. This hints at ineffective reprogramming of neurons back to a growth-competent state. Stem cell biologists have tackled a similar hurdle and emerged victorious! They discovered a while ago that a simple cocktail of four TFs is enough to reprogram any cell back to a pluripotent state. With the right set of TFs, you can effectively re-program even a fibroblast into a neuron! But the key question is how did they get there? How did they achieve such high reprogramming efficiency? First, it’s become obvious that no single TF can do much on its own. TFs are highly social, and work in large interacting groups to drive specific patterns of gene expression. In regeneration-competent neurons, injury response activates multiple hierarchical waves of TFs, that regulate thousands of genes to achieve regenerative success. Now compare that with what we have been providing injured CNS neurons. One single TF treatment. It’s no surprise that this results in inefficient reprogramming. We now know that no single TF is sufficient to mount and sustain a whole transcriptional network supportive of growth.\nThe burning question is - What are the right sets of TFs that are required to drive axon growth in CNS neurons? This has been the focus of my work, first as a post-doctoral fellow in the Blackmore lab and now as a Research Asst Professor.

In contrast, neurons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) possess a limited capacity to regenerate axons after injury, fundamentally constraining repair. Activating pro-regenerative gene expression in CNS neurons is a promising therapeutic approach, but progress is hampered by incomplete knowledge of the relevant transcription factors. An emerging hypothesis is that factors implicated in cellular growth and motility outside the nervous system may also control axon growth in neurons. We therefore tested sixty-nine transcription factors, previously identified as possessing tumor suppressive or oncogenic properties in non-neuronal cells, in assays of neurite outgrowth. This screen identified YAP1 and E2F1 as enhancers of neurite outgrowth, and PITX1, RBM14, ZBTB16, and HHEX as inhibitors. Follow-up experiments are focused on the tumor suppressor HHEX, one of the strongest growth inhibitors. HHEX is widely expressed in adult CNS neurons, including corticospinal tract neurons after spinal injury, but is present only in trace amounts in immature cortical neurons and adult peripheral neurons. HHEX overexpression in early postnatal cortical neurons reduced both initial axonogenesis and the rate of axon elongation, and domain deletion analysis strongly implicated transcriptional repression as the underlying mechanism. These findings suggest a role for HHEX in restricting axon growth in the developing CNS, and substantiate the hypothesis that previously identified oncogenes and tumor suppressors can play conserved roles in axon extension.","tags":null,"title":"The tumor suppressor HHEX inhibits axon growth when prematurely expressed in developing central nervous system neurons.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"\nAxons in the mammalian central nervous system possess low regenerative capacity, which limits functional recovery from spinal cord injury. In contrast to central nervous system (CNS) neurons, regeneration competent peripheral neurons precisely activate key genes in response to axonal injury, resulting in regenerative success.

In particular, forced expression of critical transcription factors, which can orchestrate the production of the many regeneration-associated proteins, is emerging as an effective way to improve the complex task of axon extension. In my other project , I described my work towards this line of research. It is likely, however, that another major barrier to initiating a pro-growth genetic program exists at the level of the DNA, that is, at the level of chromatin structure. We have found that genes that are not actively transcribed, such as regeneration associated genes (RAGs) in non-regenerating CNS neurons, are held in a “closed” chromatin state, rendering them inaccessible to transcription factors (TFs). As expression of most RAGs are developmentally down-regulated, the genomic loci around these genes becomes constricted, limiting gene activation and axon growth in mature CNS neurons. In this cellular context, supply of pro-regenerative TFs alone may not achieve optimal RAG activation, if the TFs are unable to bind regulatory sequences due to epigenetic constraints. In a recent manuscript, we found a direct correlation between accessibility of target genes and in vivo efficacy of pro-growth TFs. It’s therefore clear that chromatin accessibility is a major barrier to re-growth in CNS neurons, by preventing TF binding and activation.\nThe central goal of this project is to develop novel molecular strategies for the targeted removal of epigenetic constraints along with supply of pro-regenerative TFs.\nDo check out our recent manuscripts for specifics/more details:\n1) Epigenetic profiling reveals a developmental decrease in promoter accessibility during cortical maturation in vivo.\n2) Developmental chromatin restriction of pro‐growth gene networks acts as an epigenetic barrier to axon regeneration in cortical neurons\n","date":1430110800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1430110800,"objectID":"2ad6945ecfe347e0dda9879ba839875b","permalink":"https://ishwariyavenkatesh.github.io/project/accessibility/","publishdate":"2015-04-27T00:00:00-05:00","relpermalink":"/project/accessibility/","section":"project","summary":"Axons in the mammalian central nervous system possess low regenerative capacity, which limits functional recovery from spinal cord injury.

These divergent regenerative responses are in part mediated by the growth-associated expression of select transcription factors. The basic helix-loop-helix (bHLH) transcription factor, MASH1/Ascl1a, is transiently expressed during the development of many neuronal subtypes and regulates the expression of genes that mediate cell fate determination and differentiation. In the adult zebrafish (Danio rerio), Ascl1a is also transiently expressed in retinal ganglion cells (RGCs) that regenerate axons after optic nerve crush. Utilizing transgenic zebrafish with a 3.6 kb GAP43 promoter that drives expression of an enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP), we observed that knock-down of Ascl1a expression reduces both regenerative gap43 gene expression and axonal growth after injury compared to controls. In mammals, the development of noradrenergic brainstem neurons requires MASH1 expression. In contrast to zebrafish RGCs, however, MASH1 is not expressed in the mammalian brainstem after spinal cord injury (SCI). Therefore, we utilized adeno-associated viral (AAV) vectors to overexpress MASH1 in four month old rat (Rattus norvegicus) brainstem neurons in an attempt to promote axon regeneration after SCI. We discovered that after complete transection of the thoracic spinal cord and implantation of a Schwann cell bridge, animals that express MASH1 exhibit increased noradrenergic axon regeneration and improvement in hindlimb joint movements compared to controls. Together these data demonstrate that MASH1/Ascl1a is a fundamental regulator of axonal growth across vertebrates and can induce modifications to the intrinsic state of neurons to promote functional regeneration in response to CNS injury.","tags":null,"title":"MASH1/Ascl1a Leads to GAP43 Expression and Axon Regeneration in the Adult CNS","type":"publication"}]
