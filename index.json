Members of the KLF family of transcription factors can exert both positive and negative effects on axon regeneration, but the underlying mechanisms are unclear. Here we show that forced expression of KLF6 promotes axon regeneration by corticospinal tract neurons in the injured spinal cord. RNA sequencing identified 454 genes whose expression changed upon forced KLF6 expression in vitro, including sub-networks that were highly enriched for functions relevant to axon extension including cytoskeleton remodeling, lipid synthesis, and bioenergetics. In addition, promoter analysis predicted a functional interaction between KLF6 and a second transcription factor, STAT3, and genome-wide footprinting using ATAC-Seq data confirmed frequent co-occupancy. Co-expression of the two factors yielded a synergistic elevation of neurite growth in vitro. These data clarify the transcriptional control of axon growth and point the way toward novel interventions to promote CNS regeneration.","tags":null,"title":"KLF6 and STAT3 co-occupy regulatory DNA and functionally synergize to promote axon growth in CNS neurons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Venkatesh I**","Mehra V","Wang Z","Califf B","Blackmore MG"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1526947200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1526947200,"objectID":"a8cda29b499098c9a9277fa7e646d03e","permalink":"https://ishwariyavenkatesh.github.io/publication/devchrom/","publishdate":"2018-05-22T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/devchrom/","section":"publication","summary":"Axon regeneration in the central nervous system is prevented in part by a developmental decline in the intrinsic regenerative ability of maturing neurons. This loss of axon growth ability likely reflects widespread changes in gene expression, but the mechanisms that drive this shift remain unclear. Chromatin accessibility has emerged as a key regulatory mechanism in other cellular contexts, raising the possibility that chromatin structure may contribute to the age‐dependent loss of regenerative potential. Here we establish an integrated bioinformatic pipeline that combines analysis of developmentally dynamic gene networks with transcription factor regulation and genome‐wide maps of chromatin accessibility. When applied to the developing cortex, this pipeline detected overall closure of chromatin in sub‐networks of genes associated with axon growth. We next analyzed mature CNS neurons that were supplied with various pro‐regenerative transcription factors. Unlike prior results with SOX11 and KLF7, here we found that neither JUN nor an activated form of STAT3 promoted substantial corticospinal tract regeneration. Correspondingly, chromatin accessibility in JUN or STAT3 target genes was substantially lower than in predicted targets of SOX11 and KLF7. Finally, we used the pipeline to predict pioneer factors that could potentially relieve chromatin constraints at growth‐associated loci. Overall this integrated analysis substantiates the hypothesis that dynamic chromatin accessibility contributes to the developmental decline in axon growth ability and influences the efficacy of pro‐regenerative interventions in the adult, while also pointing toward selected pioneer factors as high‐priority candidates for future combinatorial experiments.","tags":null,"title":"Developmental chromatin restriction of pro‐growth gene networks acts as an epigenetic barrier to axon regeneration in cortical neurons","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Venkatesh I**","Blackmore MG"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1498176000,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1498176000,"objectID":"8684df2cd0bd9b0fed29c1116cb8e9cd","permalink":"https://ishwariyavenkatesh.github.io/publication/optimaltf/","publishdate":"2017-06-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/optimaltf/","section":"publication","summary":"Recovery from injuries to the central nervous system, including spinal cord injury, is constrained in part by the intrinsically low ability of many CNS neurons to mount an effective regenerative growth response. To improve outcomes, it is essential to understand and ultimately reverse these neuron-intrinsic constraints. Genetic manipulation of key transcription factors (TFs), which act to orchestrate production of multiple regeneration-associated genes, has emerged as a promising strategy. It is likely that no single TF will be sufficient to fully restore neuron-intrinsic growth potential, and that multiple, functionally interacting factors will be needed. An extensive literature, mostly from non-neural cell types, has identified potential mechanisms by which TFs can functionally synergize. Here we examine four potential mechanisms of TF/TF interaction; physical interaction, transcriptional cross-regulation, signaling-based cross regulation, and co-occupancy of regulatory DNA. For each mechanism, we consider how existing knowledge can be used to guide the discovery and effective use of TF combinations in the context of regenerative neuroscience. This mechanistic insight into TF interactions is needed to accelerate the design of effective TF-based interventions to relieve neuron-intrinsic constraints to regeneration and to foster recovery from CNS injury.","tags":null,"title":"Selecting optimal combinations of transcription factors to promote axon regeneration: Why mechanisms matter.","type":"publication"},{"authors":["**Venkatesh I**","Simpson MT","Coley DM","Blackmore MG"],"categories":null,"content":"","date":1479859200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1479859200,"objectID":"5dde19fa3ddeae67c373e0b5adb08d7e","permalink":"https://ishwariyavenkatesh.github.io/publication/promoter-access/","publishdate":"2016-11-23T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/promoter-access/","section":"publication","summary":"Axon regeneration in adult central nervous system (CNS) is limited in part by a developmental decline in the ability of injured neurons to re-express needed regeneration associated genes (RAGs). Adult CNS neurons may lack appropriate pro-regenerative transcription factors, or may display chromatin structure that restricts transcriptional access to RAGs. Here we performed epigenetic profiling around the promoter regions of key RAGs, and found progressive restriction across a time course of cortical maturation. These data identify a potential intrinsic constraint to axon growth in adult CNS neurons. Neurite outgrowth from cultured postnatal cortical neurons, however, proved insensitive to treatments that improve axon growth in other cell types, including combinatorial overexpression of AP1 factors, overexpression of histone acetyltransferases, and pharmacological inhibitors of histone deacetylases. This insensitivity could be due to intermediate chromatin closure at the time of culture, and highlights important differences in cell culture models used to test potential pro-regenerative interventions.","tags":null,"title":"Epigenetic profiling reveals a developmental decrease in promoter accessibility during cortical maturation in vivo.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.

In contrast, neurons in the adult central nervous system (CNS) possess a limited capacity to regenerate axons after injury, fundamentally constraining repair. Activating pro-regenerative gene expression in CNS neurons is a promising therapeutic approach, but progress is hampered by incomplete knowledge of the relevant transcription factors. An emerging hypothesis is that factors implicated in cellular growth and motility outside the nervous system may also control axon growth in neurons. We therefore tested sixty-nine transcription factors, previously identified as possessing tumor suppressive or oncogenic properties in non-neuronal cells, in assays of neurite outgrowth. This screen identified YAP1 and E2F1 as enhancers of neurite outgrowth, and PITX1, RBM14, ZBTB16, and HHEX as inhibitors. Follow-up experiments are focused on the tumor suppressor HHEX, one of the strongest growth inhibitors. HHEX is widely expressed in adult CNS neurons, including corticospinal tract neurons after spinal injury, but is present only in trace amounts in immature cortical neurons and adult peripheral neurons. HHEX overexpression in early postnatal cortical neurons reduced both initial axonogenesis and the rate of axon elongation, and domain deletion analysis strongly implicated transcriptional repression as the underlying mechanism. These findings suggest a role for HHEX in restricting axon growth in the developing CNS, and substantiate the hypothesis that previously identified oncogenes and tumor suppressors can play conserved roles in axon extension.","tags":null,"title":"The tumor suppressor HHEX inhibits axon growth when prematurely expressed in developing central nervous system neurons.","type":"publication"},{"authors":null,"categories":null,"content":"Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipiscing elit.
